# Running The Application
Making sure you are on the 'main' branch of the repo, build the project using the 'rpm > Tasks > other > buildAll' command. This will build the two Gradle files needed for the client and servlet side of the project.
To then run the local UI, start the simulation and data stream to the Tsuru website, within the path as before run the 'runAll' command. This will begin the simulation and present a UI on the local device. Please log in using the credentials:
- **Username**: Holloway
- **Password**: Nettles

This should bring you to the dashboard where you can explore the rest of the UI functionality.
Within the detailed view of the patients, a button called "Generate Report" should be visible. This can be clicked to take the user to the website, or the website can be accessed using the [link](https://bioeng-rancho-app.impaas.uk/).
